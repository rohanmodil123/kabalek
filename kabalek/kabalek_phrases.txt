I hate my wife.
All I wanted was a contract :cry:
I used to work for NASA.
Amateur Hour! Amateur Hour!
You know what this is? It's the world's smallest violin playing your sad song.
UUUUUUNNNNNIIIIITTTTTTTTSSSSSSSS
You ready for the quiz?
I told my wife to stop sending me pictures of my kids...
I am on the AP Physics I exam writing board.
I have to work as a tutor to support my wife who spends all my money.
I smell a quiz coming.
